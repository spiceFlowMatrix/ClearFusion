# Operation

This project deals with handling several integrated business processes. Each operation deals with the handling of Requests within a specific Domain. Each Request needs to be resolved or closed and resolving an issue may need to transition through several states that require input from different stakeholders and has some desired outcome.  

## Requests

All requests have at least two states - Open, Closed - and there is no limit to the number of states.
