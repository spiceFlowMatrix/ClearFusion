# UI Controls

## Employee Search Control

This control allows user to search employees by their Name and ID \(or Code\). Users enter the name, ID, or both in the appropriate sequence into the Search input and Employees that match the search text will appear as they type \(dynamically\).

## Help Tooltip & Control

This tooltip allows users to create support requests that feed directly into the GitLab Help Desk for the project.

Users can submit support requests on:

1. Connection Failed errors.
2. Request Failed errors.
3. Validation errors.
