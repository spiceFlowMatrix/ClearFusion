# Proprietary ERP Solution (Defunct)

A web-based ERP system for a non-profit organization in Afghanistan, managing Accounting, HR, Inventory, and Project Management for over 1,000 users.

## My Contributions

As CTO at EdgSolutions, I led development and optimization efforts:

- Designed a scalable microservices architecture using ASP.NET Core and Angular.
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline with GitLab CI, reducing deployment times by 90%.
- Optimized API performance by 30% and enhanced system stability through code refactoring.
- Created Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments on Google Cloud Platform.
- Specified and enforced standards for managing product development and traceable communications between all stakeholders.

> This architecture was in the middle of migration towards Clean Architecture when the project had to be shut down. See [here](https://github.com/spiceFlowMatrix/BridgeTrunk) for the WIP migration.

## DevOps Highlights

> **Note:** This project relied on several services from Google Cloud Platform and Auth0, so a live demo isnâ€™t available. The repository includes CI/CD configurations, Helm chart, and Dockerfiles used in production.

- [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](./.gitlab-ci.yml): Automated build and deployment for multiple environments.
- [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile): Containerized API and web app (built in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](./.gitlab-ci.yml)) for consistent environments.
- [Helm Chart](./k8s-chart/Chart.yaml): Managed Kubernetes deployments on GKE.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (REST API)
- **Web Frontend:** Angular
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **CI/CD:** GitLab, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform
