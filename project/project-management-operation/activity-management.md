# Activity Management

## Project Management Control Panel

Every project has a dedicated control panel for all of its Hiring Requests - the **Project Management Control Panel**. You can access this control panel by clicking the **PROJECT MANAGEMENT** tab in the Project \(Details\) Management tab panel.

You can see all existing activities listed out here and you can **Select** several Activities at a time. **Selecting** activities allows you to apply bulk operations to the selection of Activities. See [Toolbar](activity-management.md#toolbar) further details.
