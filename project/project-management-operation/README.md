# Project Management Operation

The Project Management Operation deals Activity Planning, Implementation, and Monitoring.  Every Project has a set number of Activities that need to be completed throughout a planned timeline.

Projects that need to handle large \(hundreds\) of Activities that need to go through multiple stages each will require bulk control options to make things easier. Bulk operations include:

1. Delete
2. Set Assignee
3. Add Extensions
4. Add Monitoring Entry
5. Add Sub-Activity

In order to start Project Management, you need to first have Administered a Project that has Won its bidding process. If you have not done so yet, please go here to get started on that:

Assuming you have already done so, you can start handling Activities for the Project. Please go here to get started on doing that:

{% page-ref page="activity-management.md" %}
