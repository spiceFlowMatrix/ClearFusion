# Hiring Operation

The **Hiring Operation** handles the staff management and acquisition processes for select Projects depending on needs specified in **Hiring Requests** created for that Project. Every Project requires a dedicated team to handle Project implementation activities and the **Hiring Operation** must ensure that the right people are assigned to that Project.

If you don't know what an **Operation** is, please go through this first:

{% page-ref page="../../common/operation.md" %}

The Hiring Operation is made possible in the application through dedicated pages embedded within a **Project**. If you don't have a Project \(Won\) yet, please go here to figure out how to set up a Project that's ready for the **Hiring Operation**.

Assuming a **Project** is created with the necessary setup for **Hiring Operations,** you can go here to get started on **Hiring Requests**
